# Getting Started
# Introduction
konstructor essentials adds some essential styles and components for konstructor. Generally you would use this package along with konstructor. Do not use the marko components if you are not using konstructor since the components are specific to konstructor's organization, files, and configuration. However, you are free to use the essentials css pack wherever you like.

# Requirements
- marko (for components)
- scss/sass (for the styles)

Install konstrcutor-essentials through npm. If you used konstructor-cli, it will be installed for you by default.
```
npm install konstructor-essentials
```

# Styles
To use the essential styles, import them in your scss/sass.

```
@import './node_modules/konstructor-essentials/essentials.scss';
```

# Components
Marko automatically injects the components when you install the package. You may freely use the components in your templates. See the components guides for a list of components and what they do.
