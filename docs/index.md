## More than a boilerplate, less than a framework.
Konstructor is a library built on top of [Koa](http://koajs.com/). Konstructor has everything you need to create a database backed website in seconds.

## Introduction
The docs will go over how to set up, configure, and build a website with konstructor.

## Overview
Konstructor has taken many different ideas and philosophies from projects like Ruby on Rails, Phoenix Framework, Laravel, and Create React App. The MVC (sorta) out of Ruby on Rails, the asset pipeline management out of Phoenix, asset compilation out of Laravel, and the scripts management out of Create React App. Using ideas from all of these projects has allowed us to combine the best parts together.

## Getting Started
Use the sidebar to view the docs on getting started and how to use the framework.
